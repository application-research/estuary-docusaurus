# Estuary Clients Documentation
### Estuary clients

Clients for some of our favorite langauges are generated using the open api toolkit and are automatically kept in sync when new API endpoints are deployed to estuary's production system. 

The repo for the source code to generate the clients and for resulting clients is [here](https://github.com/application-research/estuary-clients)

Click into the sidebar to learn more about the client for your specific language of choice.
